# What is Quick Exporter?
Quick Exporter is a **free** Blender addon, which allows users to configure and manage exportable packages from objects within a Blender file.

These **Export Packages** can be exported manually and/or automatically, as a single or individual **.fbx** files.

This addon is intended to act as a **set-it-and-forget-it** solution to **.fbx** exporting.

Once you've created and configured your export packages, you shouldn't need to change the Quick Exporter settings very often. Simply make changes to your file, click Export, and you're done.

# What does it accomplish?
**In Blender?**  
Quick Exporter allows for faster, easier, and more straightforward **.fbx** exporting from Blender. It saves your export data (including settings, locations, objects to include) and delegates all the work of remembering or coordinating this information into a handy editor panel.

**For game development?**  
Instead of importing your *.blend* files directly into your projects, or using Blender's built-in (but non-persistent) *Export To* functions, Quick Exporter allows you to set up an asset pipeline which disconnects your source files from your asset files. The benefit of this being: More control over export settings, locations, and update frequency.

In game engines such as **Unity** or **Unreal** this allows us to easily avoid orientation errors, incorrect exported object selections, and animation issues caused by inconsistent export settings.

# Free, huh?

Heck yeah, **100% free**.

# How to Use
Using Quick Exporter is intended to be quick and easy.

<br>

## Quick Start
1. Install addon
2. Open addon panel *(View3D > Sidebar > Quick Exporter)*
3. Create a new *'Export Package'*
4. Add a *name* to the new export package
5. Add a *path* to export your package to
6. Add any number of *objects* and/or *collections* to the new export package
7. If necessary, modify the export settings
8. Click one of the two *Export* buttons, or enable *Auto-Export*

That's it.

Now you have an Export Package which will always export the objects you've specified to the location specified, using the settings specified. This can be done with one click of a button, or when the file is saved.

<br>

## Installation
This addon can be installed by copying the contents of *quick-exporter.zip* into your Blender addons directory.

Make sure to copy the entire *quick-exporter* directory to your Blender addons directory.

<br>

## The 'Quick Exporter' Panel
This addon is controlled from a single panel in Blender, located at:  
*3D Viewport &gt; Sidebar &gt; Quick Exporter*

<br>

## Creating an Export Package
An *'Export Package'* is a collection of Blender scene objects intended to be exported to a single .fbx file.

From the Quick Exporter panel, you can create a new export package from the package list. With this complete, you'll be able to set all the necessary .fbx export settings, as well as a path for your exported .fbx file.

<br>

## Exporting an Export Package
Once you've created and configured one or more export packages, the *Export All* button will export all packages to their intended locations.

Alternatively, you may select an individual package from the list, and click the *Export 'Package'* button, where 'Package' is the name of your selected package.

<br>

## Auto-Export
In the Quick Exporter panel, there is an option to enable auto-exporting on save. You can choose one of the following options:

**Disabled**  
This will prevent Quick Exporter from automatically exporting on save. This is the default auto-export setting. With this option selected, users are required to manually use the <em>Export</em> buttons through the Quick Exporter interface.

**Auto-Export On Save**  
This will export all packages when the Blend File is saved.
